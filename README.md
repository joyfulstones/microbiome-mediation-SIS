# microbiome-mediation-SIS
This is the R code used in the paper "Testing mediation effects  in high-dimensional  microbiome compositional data". 

We propose a joint significance test procedure for the isometric logratio transformed mediators, which can effectively control the family-wise error rate (FWER). We use the sure independence screening method to identify the relevant mediators in microbiome. We apply the proposed method to test the mediation effects of human gut microbiome between the fat intake and body mass index. We identify the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes with significant mediation effects under Bonferroni's correction.
